    <h3>
        My experience setting up GitHub and Publishing to Pages.    
    </h3>
        <p class = "GitHub">
            My experience with setting up GitHub and Publishing to pages was very
            hard and confusing because it is a bit different from the experience i 
            have with GitHub and HTML. I am not used to using the two together and 
            publishing HTML code to the GitHub Repo.

        <div></div>

            After a quick tutorial on how to set up the GitHub and publish the
            page with a lot of help from Khanyi the tutor, it made
            more sense to me and much more understandable..

    <h3>
        Reflection on the readings
    </h3>
        <p class = "Reflection">
            The reading provide a clearer understanding of how most of the applications
            and websites we use came about. The reading <b>"As We Think"</b> talks about
            user interface and how it can or should influence user interactivity and this 
            can be seen in the websites we use today on a day to day lives, Apps that are 
            being released lately are mostly centered around being user friendly and pleasing
            to ones eye. The system should be designed around how humans think and behave, 
            making it natural and easy to use.
        </p>

            instead of fitting into the way a computer interacts and
            presents its data, the human cognitive and interactive processes should be paramoun

            Human understanding and cognition can be enhanced
            by tailoring information,

            In ‘As We May Think’, Vannevar Bush showed us a vision of how information could be
            manageable even on a large scale by association based on the experience of the individual.


            <p>
                The browser wars just goes to show how most of the petty competition did not start now 
                and its just been around since some browser softwares and apps were built. the same browser 
                wars that were had with NETSCAPE are very similar to the browser wars that we are witnessing with 
                the silent wars between TikTok and apps like Instagram, Youtube Shorts, Snapchat and RedNote. 

            </p>

            <p>
                Flash was used to create interactive web browsers, this software made it easier for web browsers to be 
                more interactive and help user interface more adaptable to the human experience. the software was later replaced 
                by HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. these later became what we use now in recent days for web creation and user experience.
                One of the first few softwares that used adobe flash was Youtube which later replaced it with HTML5.
                 
            </p>



            <p>
                what is interesting about the Readings is how browsers were fighting to create a better user 
                experience and these days the big companies do not try and get everyones attention, instead they 
                cater to a specific audience to avoid traffic and conflict with other big companies.

                even though it might sound somewhat unrealistic.I want to be able to do some freelance for small companies and 
                i will most probably take advantage of them but <b>Game id Game</b>, either way i wanna be able to help smaller 
                businesses get publications and get their work out there easier. i would like to create and manage websites and work 
                with bigger gaming companies that need these websites.

    <h2><u>Week 2 Blog Post  </u></h2>
    
    <p>Moulthrop’s idea on hypertext as a radical shift on how we interact with information have played out, but they 
        also have unexpected consequences. He talks about how hypertext 
        improves navigation and access to relevant information, even though 
        he does talk about whether the ease is always beneficial. Hypertext 
        helps users navigate through the web using links between relative topics and allows a linear navigation though 
        the web. Hypertext user to jump between sources quickly and effectively and discovering more connections between 
        pages, this also allows the user to have a personalised information experience instead of relying on fixed and one way
         narratives. The negative impact of hyperlinks may be that users may not engage fully into certain sources by jumping 
         endlessly through the links and losing the original context.</p>

    <p>Below is my folder structure and wireframe, this is one of the examples of how hypertext can influence navigation through 
        certain sources and pieces of information. The wireframe showcases the freedom and easy access to certain information that
         will be provided by my webpage. The lay out shows how users can navigate the whole website from a click of a mouse.
        
        <div></div>
    
        The folder structure consists of four folders that represent 4 of my current planned pages and each one is going to have 
        four folders in each folder, each one being Images, Styles, Scripts and HTML folders. Each files consists of these folders 
        to store the files and make it easier to navigate through the files that are needed in the webpage.
    </p>

    <p>My webpage design or wireframe was inspired by my experience with the World wide web. The websites and webpages that I have 
        visited were easy to navigate and easy to use. These websites are designed to make the human or use experience easier to use 
        and not the other way around where a use has to learn how to use the webpage and navigate through based on what information 
        was presented to me, instead it was built so that I can navigate the web based on what I want to engage in. Sometime the 
        world wide web can present false information and unnecessary information to the user in the form of an add, sometimes it 
        will present a video  and if a user watches the video for more than 10 or more seconds, the web thinks that the user wants 
        content like that and ends up presenting more information that’s related to that one video. With all of that, id conclude by 
        saying my experience with the WWW has its ups and downs.</p>
