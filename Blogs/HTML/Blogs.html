                        </h3>

                        
                    <p>
                        My experience with setting up GitHub and Publishing to pages was very
                        hard and confusing because it is a bit different from the experience i 
                        have with GitHub and HTML. I am not used to using the two together and 
                        publishing HTML code to the GitHub Repo.

                        After a quick tutorial on how to set up the GitHub and publish the
                        page with a lot of help from Khanyi the tutor, it made
                        more sense to me and much more understandable..
                    </p>
                                   
                <h3>
                    Reflection on the readings
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        The reading provide a clearer understanding of how most of the applications
                        and websites we use came about. The reading <b>"As We Think"</b> talks about
                        user interface and how it can or should influence user interactivity and this 
                        can be seen in the websites we use today on a day to day lives, Apps that are 
                        being released lately are mostly centered around being user friendly and pleasing
                        to ones eye. The system should be designed around how humans think and behave, 
                        making it natural and easy to use.
                    </p>
            
                        instead of fitting into the way a computer interacts and
                        presents its data, the human cognitive and interactive processes should be paramoun
            
                        Human understanding and cognition can be enhanced
                        by tailoring information,
            
                        In ‘As We May Think’, Vannevar Bush showed us a vision of how information could be
                        manageable even on a large scale by association based on the experience of the individual.
            
            
                        <p>
                            The browser wars just goes to show how most of the petty competition did not start now 
                            and its just been around since some browser softwares and apps were built. the same browser 
                            wars that were had with NETSCAPE are very similar to the browser wars that we are witnessing with 
                            the silent wars between TikTok and apps like Instagram, Youtube Shorts, Snapchat and RedNote. 
            
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            Flash was used to create interactive web browsers, this software made it easier for web browsers to be 
                            more interactive and help user interface more adaptable to the human experience. the software was later replaced 
                            by HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. these later became what we use now in recent days for web creation and user experience.
                            One of the first few softwares that used adobe flash was Youtube which later replaced it with HTML5.
                             
                        </p>
            
            
            
                        <p>
                            what is interesting about the Readings is how browsers were fighting to create a better user 
                            experience and these days the big companies do not try and get everyones attention, instead they 
                            cater to a specific audience to avoid traffic and conflict with other big companies.

                    <p>Moulthrop’s idea on hypertext as a radical shift on how we interact with information have played out, but they 
                        also have unexpected consequences. He talks about how hypertext 
                        improves navigation and access to relevant information, even though 
                        he does talk about whether the ease is always beneficial. Hypertext 
                        helps users navigate through the web using links between relative topics and allows a linear navigation though 
                        the web. Hypertext user to jump between sources quickly and effectively and discovering more connections between 
                        pages, this also allows the user to have a personalised information experience instead of relying on fixed and one way
                         narratives. The negative impact of hyperlinks may be that users may not engage fully into certain sources by jumping 
                         endlessly through the links and losing the original context.</p>
                
                    <p>Below is my folder structure and wireframe, this is one of the examples of how hypertext can influence navigation through 
                        certain sources and pieces of information. The wireframe showcases the freedom and easy access to certain information that
                         will be provided by my webpage. The lay out shows how users can navigate the whole website from a click of a mouse.
                        
                        <img src="../Images/WireFrame.png" alt="Wire Frame " class="images">
                        <img src ="../Images/Folder Structre (1).png" alt = "Folder Structure 1"  class="images">
                        <img src ="../Images/Folder Structre (2).png" alt = "Folder Structure 2"  class="images">
                
                    <br>
                        The folder structure consists of four folders that represent 4 of my current planned pages and each one is going to have 
                        four folders in each folder, each one being Images, Styles, Scripts and HTML folders. Each files consists of these folders 
                        to store the files and make it easier to navigate through the files that are needed in the webpage.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>My webpage design or wireframe was inspired by my experience with the World wide web. The websites and webpages that I have 
                        visited were easy to navigate and easy to use. These websites are designed to make the human or use experience easier to use 
                        and not the other way around where a use has to learn how to use the webpage and navigate through based on what information 
                        was presented to me, instead it was built so that I can navigate the web based on what I want to engage in. Sometime the 
                        world wide web can present false information and unnecessary information to the user in the form of an add, sometimes it 
                        will present a video  and if a user watches the video for more than 10 or more seconds, the web thinks that the user wants 
                        content like that and ends up presenting more information that’s related to that one video. With all of that, id conclude by 
                        saying my experience with the WWW has its ups and downs.</p>

                            <li>The most interesting part will be the games that I made because this is the part where they can interact with the website more instead of reading the things that I have on the website.</li>
                        </ul>
            
                    <b><u>Interface Elements</u></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am going to use buttons mostly to display some of the portfolio things like games and codework.</li>
                            <li>I am going to use a top pop up element to the navigation bar so that when the user slightly scrolls up, the navigation bar pops up.</li>
                            <li>The icons that im going to use and mostly going to the about the games and code work that I have done.</li>
                            <li>I will have dropdown lists for some of the tabs for things like my essays and weekly blog posts.</li>
                        </ul>
            
            
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                        <p>The exercise above helped me think more about the reason why im making the website and how I want the website to function not only when I use it but think about how the audience should feel when using and interacting with the website. The exercise helps me plan out the website deeper into what and how it should function and how the aesthetics of the website should show. I have thought deeper about the type of planning have to go through in order to get the type of website I have instead of just throwing stuff in the website and expecting the user to just interact with all the elements.

                Website 1 was kind of hard and confusing, it was confusing most of the time since it is not very clear what is needed and what is not. It got really hard to make 
                sure that you are getting the right things done and also making sure that you do not overdo anything. It is sometimes hard to think about the colour 
                palettes i want to choose because things may seem like they would look good in my head but as soon as i impliment the colours on a design, it does not look as good as 
                i thought.
                <p>
                The Good thing about it is that it is very easy to understand HTML and create wireframes for my Website one i have an idea solidified or if i have a clear idea of what i want 
                to do.</p>
    
                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    On my <a href ="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#WireFrames">first Wireframes</a> i had i didnt have an idea of what colours i was going to use for the website. But now as we progress ive started thinking about the <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#ColourSelection">colours</a> that i wantto use and 
                    how i want to use the specific colours. I have Started testing out colours and checking if they are good fits for my website and this process has made me realise that not every colour
                    can be on a website.
    
                <h4>Buttons</h4>
                    For My <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#Buttons">Buttons</a> i would like to use more rounded corner buttons to fit the aesthetic i have with the colours i chose. These Buttons will be used for things like navigation, Downloading files and overall UI/UX design. 
                
                <h4>Visual Designs</h4>
                    <p>For the <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#Visuals">Visual Designs</a> i Have Chosen to use the shades of Nude/Brown Colour palette, which can be seen in the Design Page.

                known for its broad coverage of local and international news. Below are some potential pros and cons for this website:

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                    <ul>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Advertising Clutter:<br>
                            Like many free news sites, News24 relies on advertisements, which can sometimes be intrusive or clutter the reading experience if not managed effectively.
                        </li>

                            The breadth of content can sometimes feel overwhelming. Casual readers may find the volume of information difficult to sift through quickly, especially during major breaking news events.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Load Times with Multimedia:<br>
                            While multimedia elements enhance the experience, users on slower internet connections may experience longer load times, which can affect accessibility in certain areas.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Complexity for First-Time Users:<br>
                            The abundance of sections and detailed coverage might intimidate new visitors who are looking for quick headlines rather than in-depth analysis.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This assessment is based on a general analysis of its features and user experiences; personal preferences and needs might lead to different evaluations for different readers.</p>

                            <p>
                                Sambuli defines digital equality as striving for equality in the digital age, 
                                a goal that remains elusive for many. She emphasizes that achieving digital
                                 equality involves examining both analog and digital aspects of political, 
                                 social, cultural, and economic dimensions in society. The aim is to ensure 
                                 that digital technologies do not exacerbate existing inequalities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Digital equality needs understanding of why these disparities persist and 
                                leveraging digital technologies to remove or eliminate them. In this case 
                                in order to truly understand and achieve digital equality, we can’t just 
                                look at current technology access or future innovations. We also need to 
                                examine the historical roots of inequality that shape who gets left behind 
                                or left out “Digital equality is as much about digging into history as it is 
                                about making sense of the present, while planning for the future”(Sambuli N, 2019).

                                One thing I liked about the article is how it looks at the issue from a social 
                                justice perspective. The authors talk about how the digital divide affects already
                                 marginalized groups more people who are poor, live in rural areas, or are from developing 
                                 countries. It made me think about how technology can be both helpful and harmful depending
                                  on how it’s shared. One of the main points the authors make is that while many people switched 
                                  to online school and work during the pandemic, a huge number of others couldn’t. They mention 
                                  that over 1.5 billion students were affected by school closures, but 40% of them didn’t have internet 
                                  access at home. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this number was even higher 82% of students couldn’t go online. 
                                  That’s shocking, and it makes you realize how much we take technology for granted in more privileged communities.

                                The article also criticizes how some governments only offered short-term fixes, like giving out a few laptops or free data. 
                                While that helped a little, it didn’t solve the bigger problem. Tataki and Glynos believe that internet access should be a 
                                human right, and I agree. In today’s world, if you don’t have access to the internet, you miss out on education, job opportunities, 
                                healthcare information, and even staying connected with others.

                                One of the key concepts Daniolou discusses is the “rural penalty.” This term refers to the disadvantages faced by rural 
                                communities due to limited internet access. She explains that rural areas often have unique cultures, languages, and products 
                                that could enrich global discussions and markets. However, without internet connectivity, these communities remain isolated. 
                                Daniolou states, “Broadband can overcome the boundaries set by physical location and bring together people, places, and business 
                                from all over the world” (Daniolou, 2020).

                                I find Daniolou’s arguments compelling, especially her emphasis on the internet as a tool for inclusion. In today’s world, lacking 
                                internet access can mean missing out on education, job opportunities, and social connections. The pandemic has made this issue even 
                                more pressing, as online platforms have become essential for many aspects of life.

                        <p>
                            In the digital age, internet access is no longer a luxury but a vital human right, 
                            essential for equal participation in education, employment, and civic life; ensuring 
                            universal access and establishing democratic governance of the internet are critical 
                            steps toward addressing the deepening digital divide and promoting global equality
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This reading focusses on how access to the internet is increasingly being viewed as a 
                            basic human right, this is presented mostly because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Drawing 
                            on ideas from Salvador Allende and recent decisions like that of the Indian Supreme 
                            Court, the text argues that lack of access to digital connectivity mirrors broader 
                            inequalities in capitalist societies. The pandemic was or has forced people to rely 
                            on the internet and digital infrastructure, deepening the divide between who can and 
                            cannot access education, employment and healthcare. The reliance on the internet and 
                            digital inequality now compounds existing social and economic disparities. The reading 
                            ends by raising two pressing questions, should internet access be universally provided, 
                            and who should govern the rules of the internet?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my opinion, the internet should be a basic human right especially when it comes to
                             how things are structured in the current economy. The internet is a primary gateway to 
                             knowledge, education and news. In an increasingly digital world, denying certain people 
                             internet can limit opportunities for learning and employment. People need to be economic 
                             and social participants, Jobs, banking healthcare and government services are increasingly 
                             moving online and digital, the lack of access to the internet can cause more inequality and 
                             marginalization in disadvantaged groups. When giving people access to the internet, it bridges 
                             geographical divides, allowing people to collaborate, share ideas, and maintain relationships
                              across borders. he COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how essential internet access is for remote 
                              learning and work. Without it, many are left behind.

                        <h3>UN internet access human right 2016</h3>
                        <p>
                            The United Nations Human Rights Council officially passed a non-binding resolution that condemns 
                            intentional disruption of internet access and affirms that internet access is a fundamental 
                            human right. This resolution reaffirms that the same rights individuals possess offline such as 
                            freedom of expression and access to information must also be protected online. the resolution emphasizes 
                            that universal internet access plays a critical role in promoting economic development, supporting 
                            education, and safeguarding democratic participation. It urges states to bridge the digital divide by 
                            ensuring affordable, inclusive, and equitable internet availability for all, particularly for marginalized
                             communities (UNHRC, 2016). In a digital age where access to information, online services, and 
                             remote communication is vital, the resolution's stance highlights the necessity of digital inclusion 
                             as a prerequisite for exercising broader human rights. By framing internet access as essential 
                             rather than optional, the UN emphasizes that a lack of connectivity can exacerbate social and economic
                              inequalities, further marginalizing vulnerable populations.

                        <p>
                            The Reading effectively Breaks Down the neoliberal fantasy of the internet as a "great equalizer.
                            " By highlighting disparities in access, representation, and safety, it underscores how race, gender,
                             class, and geography shape online experiences. The COVID-19 example powerfully illustrates how 
                             crises magnify these inequalities where privileged groups seamlessly transition online while marginalized
                              communities (particularly rural women and queer Africans) are further excluded.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reading powerfully challenges Western-dominated digital narratives by asserting that African feminists 
                            must be at the forefront of shaping an equitable internet. It rejects the colonial framing of Africa as merely
                             a passive recipient of technology, instead highlighting how African women and queer activists are pioneering
                              innovative digital solutions. Examples like Feminist Internet's chatbots demonstrate how African feminists
                               are creating culturally relevant tools that address local needs while challenging global power imbalances.
                                This resistance to technological imperialism is crucial  it centres African knowledge systems in digital 
                                spaces that have traditionally excluded them. By developing these alternatives, African feminists aren't 
                                just participating in the digital world but actively redefining its structures and possibilities on their 
                                own terms. These homegrown innovations prove Africa isn't just consuming technology but generating 
                                transformative digital approaches rooted in feminist principles and local contexts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reading makes a compelling connection between digital violence including online harassment and algorithmic 
                            bias and systemic oppression in offline spaces. This linkage becomes evident when examining the type of content 
                            that circulates under the guise of humour, often at the expense of marginalized groups, reinforcing harmful 
                            stereotypes and power imbalances. The text convincingly argues that the internet is not an isolated space but 
                            rather an extension of existing societal hierarchies, meaning feminist resistance must address both digital and 
                            material realities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When these issues go unchecked online, they inevitably spill over into real life, normalizing discrimination and 
                            violence. Social media platforms like TikTok exacerbate this problem through features like reels and short videos, 
                            which allow harmful content to spread rapidly with just a click of a "share" or "like." The ease with which degrading 
                            content is amplified demonstrates how digital spaces can perpetuate and even intensify real-world oppression. This 
                            underscores the urgent need for feminist interventions both in challenging harmful online narratives and in dismantling the 
                            offline structures that enable them. Without addressing digital injustices, we risk allowing them to embed themselves deeper 
                            into everyday life, making systemic change even more difficult to achieve.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reading advocates for more African feminist voices online, it could further talk about who gets heard and whether visibility
                             can be a trap. Even within African feminist spaces, class, education and language, it still gives privilege specific voices 
                             such as people who are well spoken and urban. This reading resonated deeply because it refuses to accept the internet as it 
                             is instead demanding radical reimagination. As someone who has witnessed both the connective power and violent exclusions of 
                             digital spaces, I appreciate its call for an internet that centres care, pleasure, and justice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The article "Making a Feminist Internet in Africa" highlights a crucial truth: the internet reflects the same inequalities we 
                            face in society. While technology offers opportunities, it often excludes marginalized voices especially African women, queer 
                            communities, and rural populations. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these gaps, showing how privilege determines who gets to 
                            participate online. However, African feminists are leading the charge for change by creating safer spaces, challenging biased 
                            algorithms, and demanding fair policies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As young people, we have a role to play in this movement. We can support feminist creators, call out online harassment, and push 
                            for digital access in underserved areas. The fight for a feminist internet isn’t just about technology it’s about justice, representation, 
                            and freedom. If we want an internet that serves everyone, we must centre the voices of those most often silenced. The future of the web 
                            should be shaped by diversity, not domination.

                            nearly all major programming languages such as if, else and while are based on English, creating an implicit 
                            barrier for non-native speakers. Similarly, Unicode the standard for text encoding prioritizes Latin scripts, while 
                            some Indigenous and minority scripts remain unsupported or poorly rendered.

                            Recently, I've implemented several important changes to my website's blog section to address usability issues that
                             were affecting the reading experience. The blog posts were originally displayed in a tightly clustered layout, with m
                             inimal spacing between articles. This dense arrangement created visual distortion and made it difficult for users 
                             to focus on individual posts, particularly when reading longer content. The lack of proper spacing between elements 
                             also led to inconsistent rendering across different devices and screen sizes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To solve these problems, I developed a JavaScript solution that introduces interactive "Read More" buttons for each 
                            blog post. This implementation gives visitors much greater control over their reading experience. Now users can choose 
                            which articles they want to expand and read in full, while keeping others in a condensed preview state. This approach 
                            not only improves readability by reducing visual clutter, but also helps pages load faster since less content is rendered 
                            initially. The expandable sections feature smooth animations that make the interaction feel natural and intuitive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking ahead, I'm planning two additional enhancements to further improve site navigation. First, I'll be adding a 
                            "Back to Top" button that will appear when users scroll down the page. This simple but effective feature will allow visitors 
                            to quickly return to the top of long pages without excessive scrolling, particularly valuable for mobile users and those 
                            reading lengthy articles. The button will be strategically positioned and designed to be noticeable without being obtrusive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These improvements are part of my ongoing effort to create a website that prioritizes user experience and accessibility. By 
                            giving visitors more control over how they interact with content and navigate the site, I aim to create a more comfortable and 
                            efficient browsing experience for all users. Each change is being carefully implemented with attention to visual design, 
                            performance impact, and accessibility standards to ensure the best possible results.

                    </h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        The internet is a huge part of our lives, but it's not always fair or safe. Right now, many websites 
                        and apps track what we do, keep us addicted, and sometimes spread lies or hate. An ethical internet would 
                        fix these problems by putting people first.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First, an ethical internet would respect our privacy. Too many companies collect our personal data what we 
                        search, where we go, even private messages and sell it to advertisers. It shouldn’t be this way. We should 
                        control our own information, with strong privacy settings and the right to delete our data if we want. 
                        Imagine if social media worked like a locked diary only you decide who sees it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Second, apps and websites shouldn’t be designed to keep us hooked. Have you ever opened TikTok or YouTube 
                        "just for a minute" and wasted an hour? That’s not an accident. Companies use tricks like endless scrolling 
                        and autoplay to make us stay longer. An ethical internet would avoid these manipulative designs and even remind 
                        us to take breaks instead of trying to trap us online.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Third, the internet should be fair to everyone. Sometimes, algorithms (the code that decides what we see) 
                        are biased. Job ads might only go to certain people, or social media might push extreme content just because it gets 
                        clicks. An ethical internet would remove these unfair biases and be transparent about how things work. We should choose 
                        what we see, not have companies decide for us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fourth, fake news and hate speech need to stop. Lies spread fast online, and some people use the internet to bully others
                         or spread dangerous ideas. An ethical internet would fact-check viral posts, remove harmful content, and teach people how 
                         to spot misinformation. The internet should help us find the truth, not drown us in lies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the internet should be sustainable and available to all. Right now, data centres use tons of electricity, and not 
                        everyone can afford good internet access. An ethical internet would run on clean energy, be affordable, and work for people 
                        with disabilities like having screen readers for the blind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can all help make the internet better. Use apps that respect privacy, like Signal instead of WhatsApp. Be mindful of screen 
                        time, and don’t share posts unless you know they’re true. If we demand fairer rules and make smarter choices, we can create an 
                        internet that helps people instead of exploiting them. The internet should be a place for learning, creativity, and real connection 
                        not just profits and manipulation.
