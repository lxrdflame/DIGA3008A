                <h2>Week 1 Blog Post  </h2>
                <h3>
                    My experience setting up GitHub and Publishing to Pages.    
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        My experience with setting up GitHub and Publishing to pages was very
                        hard and confusing because it is a bit different from the experience i 
                        have with GitHub and HTML. I am not used to using the two together and 
                        publishing HTML code to the GitHub Repo.

                        After a quick tutorial on how to set up the GitHub and publish the
                        page with a lot of help from Khanyi the tutor, it made
                        more sense to me and much more understandable..
                    </p>
                                   
                <h3>
                    Reflection on the readings
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        The reading provide a clearer understanding of how most of the applications
                        and websites we use came about. The reading <b>"As We Think"</b> talks about
                        user interface and how it can or should influence user interactivity and this 
                        can be seen in the websites we use today on a day to day lives, Apps that are 
                        being released lately are mostly centered around being user friendly and pleasing
                        to ones eye. The system should be designed around how humans think and behave, 
                        making it natural and easy to use.
                    </p>
            
                        instead of fitting into the way a computer interacts and
                        presents its data, the human cognitive and interactive processes should be paramoun
            
                        Human understanding and cognition can be enhanced
                        by tailoring information,
            
                        In ‘As We May Think’, Vannevar Bush showed us a vision of how information could be
                        manageable even on a large scale by association based on the experience of the individual.
            
            
                        <p>
                            The browser wars just goes to show how most of the petty competition did not start now 
                            and its just been around since some browser softwares and apps were built. the same browser 
                            wars that were had with NETSCAPE are very similar to the browser wars that we are witnessing with 
                            the silent wars between TikTok and apps like Instagram, Youtube Shorts, Snapchat and RedNote. 
            
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            Flash was used to create interactive web browsers, this software made it easier for web browsers to be 
                            more interactive and help user interface more adaptable to the human experience. the software was later replaced 
                            by HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. these later became what we use now in recent days for web creation and user experience.
                            One of the first few softwares that used adobe flash was Youtube which later replaced it with HTML5.
                             
                        </p>
            
            
            
                        <p>
                            what is interesting about the Readings is how browsers were fighting to create a better user 
                            experience and these days the big companies do not try and get everyones attention, instead they 
                            cater to a specific audience to avoid traffic and conflict with other big companies.

                <h2>Week 2 Blog Post  </h2>
                
                <p>Moulthrop’s idea on hypertext as a radical shift on how we interact with information have played out, but they 
                    also have unexpected consequences. He talks about how hypertext 
                    improves navigation and access to relevant information, even though 
                    he does talk about whether the ease is always beneficial. Hypertext 
                    helps users navigate through the web using links between relative topics and allows a linear navigation though 
                    the web. Hypertext user to jump between sources quickly and effectively and discovering more connections between 
                    pages, this also allows the user to have a personalised information experience instead of relying on fixed and one way
                     narratives. The negative impact of hyperlinks may be that users may not engage fully into certain sources by jumping 
                     endlessly through the links and losing the original context.</p>
            
                <p>Below is my folder structure and wireframe, this is one of the examples of how hypertext can influence navigation through 
                    certain sources and pieces of information. The wireframe showcases the freedom and easy access to certain information that
                     will be provided by my webpage. The lay out shows how users can navigate the whole website from a click of a mouse.
                    
                    <img src="../Images/WireFrame.png" alt="Wire Frame " >
                    <img src ="../Images/Folder Structre (1).png" alt = "Folder Structure 1"  >
                    <img src ="../Images/Folder Structre (2).png" alt = "Folder Structure 2"  >
            
                <br>
                    The folder structure consists of four folders that represent 4 of my current planned pages and each one is going to have 
                    four folders in each folder, each one being Images, Styles, Scripts and HTML folders. Each files consists of these folders 
                    to store the files and make it easier to navigate through the files that are needed in the webpage.
                </p>
            
                <p>My webpage design or wireframe was inspired by my experience with the World wide web. The websites and webpages that I have 
                    visited were easy to navigate and easy to use. These websites are designed to make the human or use experience easier to use 
                    and not the other way around where a use has to learn how to use the webpage and navigate through based on what information 
                    was presented to me, instead it was built so that I can navigate the web based on what I want to engage in. Sometime the 
                    world wide web can present false information and unnecessary information to the user in the form of an add, sometimes it 
                    will present a video  and if a user watches the video for more than 10 or more seconds, the web thinks that the user wants 
                    content like that and ends up presenting more information that’s related to that one video. With all of that, id conclude by 
                    saying my experience with the WWW has its ups and downs.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I have my portfolio that contains all the games I’ve made and the ones that I’ve works on in groups.</li>
                            <li>I will post the code work for employers and people in the industry can reference and see what kind of work I am capable of doing and showcase my skill level when it comes to coding for games and websites.</li>
                            <li>I will also be posting some of my academic work like the blog posts and the essays that I will be working on this year.</li>
                            <li>I will be making posts about my Game Design company and how it came about and how its going.</li>

                    <b>What is most important?</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The most important content is the game design section since I want to pursue a career in Game programming, so I need that part to stand out more than everything in the website without shining the light onto it too much and neglecting the other content I have on there.
                                What is most interesting?</li>
                            <li>The most interesting part will be the games that I made because this is the part where they can interact with the website more instead of reading the things that I have on the website.</li>
                        </ul>
            
                    <b><u>Interface Elements</u></b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I am going to use buttons mostly to display some of the portfolio things like games and codework.</li>
                            <li>I am going to use a top pop up element to the navigation bar so that when the user slightly scrolls up, the navigation bar pops up.</li>
                            <li>The icons that im going to use and mostly going to the about the games and code work that I have done.</li>
                            <li>I will have dropdown lists for some of the tabs for things like my essays and weekly blog posts.</li>
                        </ul>
            
            
                    <b>Reflection</b>
                        <br>
                        The exercise above helped me think more about the reason why im making the website and how I want the website to function not only when I use it but think about how the audience should feel when using and interacting with the website. The exercise helps me plan out the website deeper into what and how it should function and how the aesthetics of the website should show. I have thought deeper about the type of planning have to go through in order to get the type of website I have instead of just throwing stuff in the website and expecting the user to just interact with all the elements.

                <h2>Week 4 Blog Post</h2>
            
                Website 1 was kind of hard and confusing, it was confusing most of the time since it is not very clear what is needed and what is not. It got really hard to make 
                sure that you are getting the right things done and also making sure that you do not overdo anything. It is sometimes hard to think about the colour 
                palettes i want to choose because things may seem like they would look good in my head but as soon as i impliment the colours on a design, it does not look as good as 
                i thought.
                <br>
                The Good thing about it is that it is very easy to understand HTML and create wireframes for my Website one i have an idea solidified or if i have a clear idea of what i want 
                to do.
    
                <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    On my <a href ="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#WireFrames">first Wireframes</a> i had i didnt have an idea of what colours i was going to use for the website. But now as we progress ive started thinking about the <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#ColourSelection">colours</a> that i wantto use and 
                    how i want to use the specific colours. I have Started testing out colours and checking if they are good fits for my website and this process has made me realise that not every colour
                    can be on a website.
    
                <h4>Buttons</h4>
                    For My <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#Buttons">Buttons</a> i would like to use more rounded corner buttons to fit the aesthetic i have with the colours i chose. These Buttons will be used for things like navigation, Downloading files and overall UI/UX design. 
                
                <h4>Visual Designs</h4>
                    For the <a href="../../Design/HTML/Design.html#Visuals">Visual Designs</a> i Have Chosen to use the shades of Nude/Brown Colour palette, which can be seen in the Design Page.
